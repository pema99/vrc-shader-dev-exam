\section*{Exam structure}
Welcome to the Shader Dev discord server. This entry exam is designed to not only test your knowledge in the topic of shaders, but also in the meme culture within in the discord server. The exam consists of 3 sections, one containing multiple choice questions, one containing open-ended questions, and finally a section where you will implement your own shader. The grade weightings for each section are given in the section titles. You are not at all expected to answer every question, just get as much correct as you can.\\

Note: Don't take any of this serious, we are just shitposting and having fun. If you can't answer anything, don't feel bad - there may not even be a \texttt{real} answer. A good chunk of the questions do actually have serious answers, though.

\section*{Part 1 - Multiple choice (25\%)}
This section consists of multiple choice questions. Each question has only 1 correct answer, although you may still receive partial points for an incorrect answer, provided that the answer you have selected is sufficiently close to the correct one. If you are completely lost on a specific question, feel free to supply with explanations of your thought process in textual form.

\newpage\section*{Part 2 - Open ended questions (35\%)}
This section contains open ended questions. Each of these questions demand a textual answer, and can have multiple correct answers. For full points, don't just provide a correct answer, but also argue how you arrived to it. If you use any external sources, make sure to write them down.

\end{minted}
\vspace{100pt}

\question How would you determine within a fragment shader if the triangle being shaded is front-facing or not?

    float t = 0;
    float3 p = ro;
    for (uint i = 0; i < _Iterations; i++) {
        p += ro + rd * t;
        float dist = map(p);
        if (t > _MaxDist || dist < _MinDist) break;
        t += dist;

}
\end{minted}

\question What is the difference between a codelet and a graphlet? Is one objectively more intelligent than the other?

\question Describe how lights with a color set to black can be useful. Also, for extra credits, describe how lights producing NaN values can be useful.
\vspace{100pt}

\question Write a snippet of code which samples a \texttt{tex} field declared as \texttt{Texture2D<float4> tex;} at lod level 3, using the uv coordinates \texttt{uv}, and without directly using any member functions like \texttt{.Sample}, \texttt{.SampleLod}, \texttt{.Load}, or similar.\\ \textit{Hint: It might be worth looking at MSDN pages for Texture2D operators for this one.}
\vspace{100pt}

\end{questions}
\newpage\section*{Part 3 - Free form implementation (40\%)}
For this section, you are tasked with implementing a shader of your own choosing. It should reasonably demonstrate your knowledge of the topic. Raw source code submissions and shaders created with node-based tools such as Amplify are both fine. All sources used in the submission should be credited with comments in the Shader source code. We suggest \textbf{not} using surface shaders, though they are permitted.\\

Below are suggestions meant as inspiration for your own submission:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Small toon shader
    \item Outline shader
    \item Panosphere shader
    \item Raytracer
    \item Raymarcher
    \item Geometry shader cloning
    \item GPU particles
    \item Literally any HDRP shader
    \item A neat compute shader
\end{enumerate}
